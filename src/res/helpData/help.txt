Not yet, but don’t worry, future updates will definitely incorporate syncing with your other devices. 


What is InstaScore? 
InstaScore basically tells you how much you’ve consumed out of how much you initially had. So a score of 80 means you’ve consumed 80% of all the food you owned.

My barcode scanner is showing a different best before date from the best before date given in product. Why?

First off we’re sorry for the inconvenience that it caused you. This, could be for two reasons:
	1.	The best before date displayed could be from InstaFresh’s existing database which could essentially skew the best before date. 
	2.	Another reason could be due to positioning of the camera or not waiting until capture the barcode.*

How to give suggestions/ feature requests?
You can always message us through our Facebook page (InstaFresh App) or even post a comment on App Store with your desired requests. Hopefully we will be able to account for those in the future updates. 

How is InstaFresh different from other food waste apps?

User satisfaction is key to us. We have built this app due to the fact that we haven’t come across any user friendly, easy to use app that has no hidden costs AND that doesn’t get stuck. We believe InstaFresh will help users track their food waste through the InstaScore platform and make sure you keep increasing your score. But hey look out for future updates!!

*Disclaimer: InstaFresh is NOT responsible for the best before date it displays. Please make sure you double check the best before date before you click save. Therefore, what you enter is what we show.
